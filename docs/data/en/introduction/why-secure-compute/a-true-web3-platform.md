# A True Web3 Platform

Current blockchain projects struggle to fully embody the DOVE principles due to a lack of true Web3 DApp development infrastructure. While an increasing number of Web3 infrastructure projects are emerging, offering decentralized and transparent approaches for accessing blockchains, they often fall short of providing comprehensive solutions.

Typically, the DApp front end and middleware are still built using traditional Web 2.0 methods, relying on frameworks like React and Vue.js. As a result, the DApps are often hosted on centralized solutions that offer little transparency to end users.

Another significant issue in the DApp development environment is the persistence of the Web 2.0 approach of "anything goes." Existing frameworks such as React and Vue.js promote flexibility by allowing developers to utilize nested libraries of code. While this results in unlimited possibilities, it also creates challenges in terms of auditing and exposes projects to substantial hacking risks due to the use of unreviewed and unaudited code libraries.

Unless there is a change in this approach, the security and adoption risks linked to Web3 will threaten the industry's future.
