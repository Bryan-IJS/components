# DECOM Portal

The DECOM portal enables web3 users to conveniently confirm the authenticity of DApps, Docs and more from a single convenient site.  The portal will also provide instructions to users to further self-validate directly from blockchain explorers for the so-inclined.

Validators also use the portal to validate and sign-off on newly updated project information.

The DECOM Portal will have the following modules:

* Project and Package Registration (Module that owner uses to edit Project information)&#x20;
* Project and Package Registry (Module that public uses to view Project information)&#x20;
* Auditors Module&#x20;
* Validators Module&#x20;
* Curator Module&#x20;
* Bucket Management Module
