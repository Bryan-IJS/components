# Ecosystem Members

Secure Compute is a community-driven ecosystem, called the ‘VALIGLATORS’ that are incentivized through a $DECOM utility token and common guiding objective of bringing greater decentralization, transparency, accountability and security to the web3 ecosystem through the following roles:

* **DECOM Node Operators**: Node operators provide the technical computing resources for the hosting DECOM Docs and DECOM Dapps and also host the DECOM Portal. Node Operators are compensated for their services through fees collected from projects they service.
* **DECOMators**: DECOMators sign and authenticate registered information such as social media accounts and url domains to protect against phishing attacks. DECOMators are compensated by a ‘VAlidate-to-earn’ mechanism that rewards DECOMators for verifying validity of project information.
* **DECOM Auditors**: A decentralized network of Auditors familiarized with the Secure Compute platform, perform audits on DECOM Dapps to ensure that registered information is accurate and that key DApp vulnerabilities are addressed before they can be introduced. SC Auditors are compensated from the projects they audit.
* **DECOM Curators**: Curators are typically VCs, incubators, launchpads or web3 project stakeholders that use their $DECOM token holding to ‘signal’ projects that are deserving of a project grant and in the process earn an APY%-based reward for their staked support.
* **DECOM Ambassadors**: Ambassadors evangelize, train and support new entrants to the Secure Compute ecosystem.
