# Features of the DECOM Platform

## Major Features
### 1. Verifiable Frontend
The DECOM Platform features an open-source framework where the frontend is audited and deployed with Subresource Integrity (SRI) and IPFS content-addressing system. This ensures that any resources loaded by the application have not been tampered with, enhancing security.
### 2. Verifiable User Accounts
User accounts are verifiable through Blockchain-Powered Attestation Service and integrated Soulbound KYC NFTs from trusted institutions. This feature allows users to establish a unique, verifiable digital identity, enhancing trust and accountability within the platform.
### 3. Verifiable User Data
All data and server requests are signed using the user's private key. This cryptographic approach ensures that any assets or data loaded during the user session are checked for authenticity and integrity, ensuring that users interact with genuine contents.
### 4. Verifiable Confidential Computing Backend
Backend servers run on Confidential Containers (currently supports AWS Nitro Enclaves), providing a secure environment for processing sensitive data. The use of remote attestation allows the frontend to verify the integrity of the backend servers, ensuring that they are operating as intended.

## Other Features
### 1. IPFS Integration
Integrated with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), the platform allows for decentralized storage of data. This integration ensures that user data is stored in a distributed manner, making it more resilient to censorship and data loss.
### 2. Crypto Wallet Support
The platform includes a built-in cryptocurrency wallet that supports Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains. This feature allows users to manage their digital assets securely and easily within the platform.
### 3. Nostr Protocol Support
The DECOM Platform supports the Nostr protocol, facilitating decentralized communication and enhancing user privacy and data ownership.
### 4. Blockchain-Registered Code
All source code for both the frontend and backend is audited and registered in a blockchain smart contract. This transparency allows users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the platform's codebase.
